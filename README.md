# OIBSIP Internship Tasks

Welcome to my internship project repository! Below are the tasks I have worked on during my internship:

## Task-01: Iris Flower Classification

In this task, I implemented multiple classification model after data preprocessing to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The goal was to explore various machine learning algorithms and techniques for classification tasks.

## Task-02: Unemployment Analysis in India

For this task, I analyzed unemployment data across different states in India. I performed exploratory data analysis to understand the trends and patterns in unemployment rates over time. Additionally, I used visualization techniques to identify factors contributing to unemployment and potential regional disparities.

## Task-03: Car Price Prediction

In this task, I trained multiple machine learning models to predict the selling price of used cars. I explored regression algorithms and techniques to train the model using features and historical data.
